This repository contain the code which is used for optimizing the global memory access of the LSTM algorithm implementation in GPU.

The lstm algorithm are implemented elementwise and blockwise in this work. The different versions of elementwise and blockwise approach are implemented to attain the desired objectives. 

The code of these implementations are written in CUDA.
